These are some of my modified scripts based on insertnamehere and litework scripts.
Some friends of mine (and my alts) were having a hard time building their army so i modified these scripts in order to help them (thats why the info is in Portuguese/Brazil in some)

Tested in Grimlite Ligma (1.7.1)

The Ultras (dailies and Weeklies) Scripts works exactly like insert's. In case you're having trouble understanding anything, look after insert's original version.

I also made this roadmap for building your army: [AQW Progress RoadMap](https://www.mindmeister.com/app/map/3695429116?t=nTS2Sjt4yr)
